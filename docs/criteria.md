##### How to Judge Submissions
1. Is the code clean? 
    1. Are class, method, and variable names meaningful?
    1. Is the code well organized?
    1. Can you read the code and understand what is going on?
1. Is the solution well designed?
    1. Has the problem been broken down into testable chunks?
    1. Are abstractions coherent and loosely coupled?
        1. Have input parsing, model creation, querying, and output been separated?
1. Is the solution tested?
    1. Is there reasonable coverage of happy path and edge cases?
        1. Have they tested with 0, 1, lots of nodes?
    1. Are dependencies mocked/stubbed/faked?
    1. Is the test code clean?
1. Are they using a reasonable algorithm? everything should be at most O(n)
1. Are comments readable? Are assumptions documented?
