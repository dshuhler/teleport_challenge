#### Teleportation Coding Challenge Reference Implementation

[See problem definition here](problem.md)

[See criteria for judging here](criteria.md)

##### Background
This coding challenge attempts to test developer skill in a variety of areas. The candidate will have to do the following:
1. Parse a text file
1. Move the parsed data into a useful data structure (a graph)
1. Implement a relatively simple algorithm (searching a graph)
1. Come up with a way to encapsulate and execute queries
1. Write unit tests for the above

This implementation is intended to represent a skillful submission using Java. The design also does not represent the 
only or necessarily the *best* approach to solving the problem.
